# simple-ai-disk-scanner
CLI disc scanner with AI under the hood
You can scan and index any directory on your disc or even the whole partition. It will create database not only with the basic meta data from your files but also will try to find the context. For instance it could find text on the images. Not a perfect solution but it works.
